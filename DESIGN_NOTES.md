# Kai Project – DESIGN\_NOTES.md

## Vision & Emotional Intent

Kai isn’t just another app. It should feel like a safe, emotionally warm space—less like tech, more like a cozy garden you visit when the world feels overwhelming.

* Tone: Uplifting, non-corporate, and emotionally intelligent.
* Visual Influence: Township, Animal Crossing, Pinterest, and Spotify Wrapped—but for your heart.
* Moodboard Keywords: Light, soulful, gentle motion, handwritten vibes, sunlit edges, responsive expression.

## Kai's Visual Identity

* Primary Visual Symbol: Animated Samoyed (Kai) with subtle mood-shifting animations based on emotional tone
* Style Keywords: Soft shadows, rounded corners, breathable white space, cute without being infantilizing
* Kai vs. Eden:

  * Kai = emotional resonance, warmth, sunlight
  * Eden = reflective, grounded, tree-of-life archetype

## UI/UX Design Themes

* "Feel > Feature" — prioritize emotional response over tech flashiness
* Microinteractions matter: typing dots, breathing animations, light haptics (eventually)
* Each action should feel like a small kindness
* Avoid sterile or transactional layouts—this is not a chatbot interface

## Notes for Future Designers

You’re not designing a UI—you’re designing a feeling.

* Avoid corporate UX tropes, over-gamification, or overly masculine interfaces
* Do study emotionally intelligent design: meditation apps, affirmations, visual journaling
* Every color, motion, sound should be selected like you're speaking to someone with a tender heart

## Suggested Experiments

* Sunlight shifting UI gradient
* Mood-sensitive avatar blinking/eye direction
* Unlockable emotional “stamps” or journaling frames
